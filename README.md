# Gesture Video Player

## Description
A simple Python project that uses OpenCV to detect hand gestures (open and closed palm) to control video playback. This project demonstrates basic computer vision techniques to interact with a video player using hand gestures.

## Features
- **Play/Pause**: Open palm to play the video, closed palm to pause it.
- **Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition**: Uses OpenCV and other libraries for hand gesture recognition.
- **Basic Video Controls**: Play and stop a video based on gestures detected through the webcam.

## Requirements
- Python 3.13.3
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
